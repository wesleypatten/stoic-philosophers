        <h1>Stoic Philosophy</h1>
        <p>Stoicism is an ancient philosophy that teaches the development of self-control and resilience as a means of overcoming destructive emotions. It emphasizes accepting things beyond our control and focusing on our own actions and perceptions. The Stoic mindset fosters inner peace, rational thinking, and moral virtue.</p>
        <p>Three of the most influential Stoic philosophers were Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus. Each contributed significantly to the philosophy, leaving behind writings that continue to inspire people today.</p>
