            <p>Epictetus was a Greek Stoic philosopher born into slavery. He believed that philosophy is a way of life, emphasizing self-discipline, control over one's thoughts, and accepting what is beyond our control. His teachings are compiled in the <em>Discourses</em> and the <em>Enchiridion</em>.</p>
